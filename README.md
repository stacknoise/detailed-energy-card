# Detailed Energy Card

Home Assistant Lovelace card showing the power flow from sources (PV, battery, grid) through the home, optional floors and rooms down to individual consumers. See [Entwicklungskonzept.md](Entwicklungskonzept.md) for the full concept and roadmap.

Status: **0.7.2** (see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)). Configure it in the visual editor (German and English) or in YAML.

## Preview

Home → floor → room → consumers. Click a floor to show its rooms (all of them are selected), click a room to list just its consumers. Click the selected room again to see all rooms of the floor together, click the selected floor again (or the home) to select all floors and list every consumer.

The card screenshots are rendered from mock data with `npm run screenshots`.

### Visual editor

Everything can be configured without YAML. Floors and rooms are picked from the floors and areas of your Home Assistant; the editor has a German and an English UI.

The editor screenshots are taken in a real Home Assistant.

## Install (HACS)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=stacknoise&repository=detailed-energy-card&category=plugin)

Click the button above to add the repository to HACS on your Home Assistant instance, or do it manually:

1. Open HACS → ⋮ → **Custom repositories**.
2. Enter `https://github.com/stacknoise/detailed-energy-card` and choose the type **Dashboard**.
3. Search for *Detailed Energy Card* in HACS and click **Download**.
4. Reload the browser. HACS registers the resource `/hacsfiles/detailed-energy-card/detailed-energy-card.js` automatically.
5. Add the card to a dashboard: **Add card → Detailed Energy Card**, or use `type: custom:detailed-energy-card` in YAML.

## Renamed from `energy-card`

The card was renamed to `detailed-energy-card` (HACS needs the file name to match the repository name). Existing dashboards must change `type: custom:energy-card` to `type: custom:detailed-energy-card`. In HACS remove the old *Energy Card* entry and add `https://github.com/stacknoise/detailed-energy-card` as custom repository; the old resource `/hacsfiles/energy-card/energy-card.js` can be deleted from the dashboard resources. The stored room selection is reset once.

## Example

```yaml
type: custom:detailed-energy-card
title: Energiefluss
home:
  total_entity: sensor.hausverbrauch_power
sources:
  - { entity: sensor.pv_leistung, type: solar, name: PV }
  - { entity: sensor.akku_leistung, type: battery, soc_entity: sensor.akku_soc }
  - { entity: sensor.netz_leistung, type: grid }
floors:
  - floor_id: erdgeschoss   # a floor from Home Assistant
    rooms:
      - area_id: kueche   # an area from Home Assistant
        consumers:
          - entity: sensor.backofen_power
            name: Backofen
```

The *Self-sufficiency* badge (share of the consumption not drawn from the grid) needs a source of type `grid`; without one, or while a grid sensor is unavailable, the badge is hidden. Floors and rooms are not free text: they are picked from the floors and areas that already exist in Home Assistant (`floor_id`, `area_id`); names and icons come from there, and the home name is your instance's location name. Options: `options.unit` (`W`, `kW`, `auto`; default `W`), `options.decimals` (0–20, for kW values), `options.animation`, `options.show_unassigned`, `options.remember_selection` and `options.wrap_rooms` (wrap more than 6 rooms into two rows instead of scrolling). A sensor can be assigned to one consumer only (the editor hides sensors that are already taken; the same sensor twice in YAML is a configuration error). Use either `floors` or `rooms` on the top level.

**Idle and thresholds:** consumers that draw no power (under 1 W) are shown faded in the list, and rooms and floors without consumption are faded in the diagram. To color lines and list bars by power, add thresholds (in watts); from each `from` value upwards the color applies, below the first one the normal color is used:

```yaml
colors:
  thresholds:
    - { from: 0, color: "#4caf50" }
    - { from: 500, color: "#ff9800" }
    - { from: 2000, color: "#f44336" }
```

In the visual editor they are under *Colors → Thresholds* (with a traffic-light preset). Every color field takes a single CSS color: hex (`#9184d9`), `rgb()`/`hsl()`, a named color (`orange`) or a theme variable (`var(--primary-color)`); anything else is a configuration error. Only `sensor.*` power entities (W / kW / MW) are supported; a sensor with another unit (for example kWh or V) is not counted as watts and shows a warning on its node. A battery state-of-charge sensor (`soc_entity`) must report `%`. All options are documented in the concept, section 3.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test            # unit tests (Vitest)
npm run build       # dist/detailed-energy-card.js
npm run test:e2e    # browser tests (Playwright) against dev/index.html
npm run screenshots # re-render docs/screenshots/*.png
npm run icon        # re-render docs/icon.png and docs/social-preview.png
```

Releases: raise `version` in `package.json`, merge, then push the tag `v<version>`; the release workflow refuses a tag that does not match. Add the changes to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) first.

`npx vite` serves `dev/index.html`, a mock-data preview. Pick a scenario with `?scenario=floors|flat|many|wrap|invalid`.

Locally the browser tests use the installed Microsoft Edge; in CI they use Chromium (`npx playwright install chromium`).
